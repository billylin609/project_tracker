understand cmake and develop custom working environment
https://cmake.org/

why cmake? 
maintain build and install process.

using text file to specify the build parameter => cmake generate file for integrated development enviornments (code editor + compiler + debugger + build automation tools)

cmake also help in supporting optional components => consolidate all the process into easy to understand format




Can we make an cmake alternative?
What will be the advantage of using the new customize system or cmake is already good enough for use?
