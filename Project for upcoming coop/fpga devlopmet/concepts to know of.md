binary arithmetic
	IEEE 754
	
Logic gates

for FPGA the key is to implement the design into the FPGA circuit

Question 1:
What is an FPGA?
FPGA have fundamental logic cells to create digital circuit
each logic blocks can be configure in certain ways
and can combine together to form any number of digital circuit

FPGA can have internal RAM and clock
and some might even has certain peripherals 

logic cells is grouped into logic blocks to create FPGA fabric

can use FPGA to create soft core to simulate general used processor
however MCU is design to use the current capacity to achieve all the design purpose
FPGA can configured to a specific use or a general one
