The tracking antenna

motor use: 
HS-785HB Servo

PWM signal

HAL_start_pwm

pwm protocol start at 50hz

need at min 8 μsec 

each μsec is 1.57 degree
max rotate is 2826 degree
which is 1800 μsec 

software limit will thus set to be 7.85 turn
or to simpler just to count 7

max second is 600-2400 μsec

20 ms = 20000μsec
