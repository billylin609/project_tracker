Question: If it possible to use BGA for the project?

Answer: Yes, the soultion is to use reflow tool to achieve that.

detailed answer: There are two requirments in order to make a pcb
Part one:
A flat pcb board being manufactured
part two:
a smd stencil(a mold to add paste onto the pcb)

e.g nextPCB are able to direct manufacture it: https://www.nextpcb.com/?utm_campaign=pcb-ca&adgroupid=98382995454&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=pcb%20printing&device=c&network=g&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI54b3paul_AIVDPnICh3uQAKwEAAYASAAEgI8PvD_BwE

under the characterization of SMT, which stands for surface mount technology
SMD stands for surface mount device.
the technology use the batch (a group of) solder reflow processes
PWBs -> PCBs  after manufacturing
