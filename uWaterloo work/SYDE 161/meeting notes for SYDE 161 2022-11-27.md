meeting notes for SYDE 161 2022-11-27

need three more effective meeting to finish the design dayz assignment

after 9pm sound good to everyone

Having router aluminum foil card board

1. card board for structure support
2. aluminum foil will help us to deflect the signal
3. router transmit signal
4. duck tape (hananna will bring it)

1. analyzing tool: Windows wifi analyzer

Goal increase the strength of the signal

solution 1: to make a sphere that can deflect the signal from directional antenna make sure there is some space between the antenna and the aluminum


solution 2: more like a straight line that close to the antenna?

we need to create cad model => Eric for sure will do it.

Data must be used in analyzation and recorded
